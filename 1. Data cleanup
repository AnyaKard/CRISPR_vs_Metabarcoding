# 1. Data cleanup

Raw fastq files were quality trimmed using FastP v 0.23.3 (S. Chen et al., 2018) to remove adapters 
and low quality bases (S. Chen et al., 2018). Per-cycle quality profiles, per-cycle base contents, 
adapter trimming results and k-mer counts were checked to ensure trimming was successful.
